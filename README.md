## Overview

**The Labrynth** is an open-source frontend built using the custom Python-based [`REACHER`](https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/reacher) suite designed to support experimental paradigms involving head-fixed rodents. It supports connections to multiple microcontrollers and facilitates running multiple sessions simultaneously from the same computer or across distributed systems.

---

## **Setup Options**

### **Setup 1: Simple Configuration**

This setup is straightforward and ideal for smaller experiments but can become computationally intensive as the number of sessions increases. 
Please refer to the [Recommended Specs](#recommended-specifications) for system requirements.

**Components:**
- A single computer
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO) with compatible firmware installed (download [here](https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/REACHER-Firmware))
- USB-A to USB-B connector

### **Setup 2: Distributed Configuration**

For experiments involving multiple sessions, this configuration distributes computational tasks, assigning each microcontroller to a dedicated machine. It is highly efficient and scales better than the simple configuration.

**Components:**
- Primary computer
- Secondary machine (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for each microcontroller
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO)
- USB-A to USB-B connector

---

## **Suite Components**

### **Dashboard Application**

**The Labrynth** is a browser-based interface built using the `Panel` library. The dashboard enables users to:
- Launch multiple experimental sessions through dynamically added tabs.
- Monitor and control each session independently while maintaining isolation between them.

#### **Features**:
- **Session Management**: Each session tab corresponds to an isolated REACHER instance, ensuring independent data handling.
- **Responsive Interface**: The interface supports dynamic updates, with real-time data displayed using `Plotly` graphs.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be modular, the dashboard can accommodate additional hardware components and experiment types.

To launch the dashboard, the application uses `BootstrapTemplate` for theming and responsive design.
